[.lead]
`identifier` is a rule that parses an identifier.

It can be created using two overloads.
The first overload takes a {{% token-rule %}} that matches the `leading` character of the identifier,
and one that matches all `trailing` characters after the first.
The second overload takes just one {{% token-rule %}} and uses it both as `leading` and `trailing` characters.

Parsing::
  Matches and consumes the token `.pattern()` (see below).
  Then verifies that the lexeme formed from `.pattern()` (excluding any trailing whitespace), is not reserved (see below).
Branch parsing::
  Tries to match and consume the token `.pattern()` (see below), backtracking if that fails.
  Otherwise it checks for reserved identifiers and backtracks if it was reserved.
  As such, branch parsing only raises errors due to the implicit whitespace skipping.
Errors::
  * All errors raised by `.pattern()`. The rule then fails if not during branch parsing.
  * `lexy::reserved_identifier`: if the identifier is reserved; its range covers the identifier.
    The rule then recovers.
Values::
  A single {{% docref "lexy::lexeme" %}} that is the parsed identifier (excluding any trailing whitespace).
Parse tree::
  The single token node created by `.pattern()` (see below).
  Its kind cannot be overridden.

{{% playground-example identifier "Parse a C like identifier" %}}

TIP: Use the character classes from {{% docref "lexy::dsl::ascii" %}} for simple identifier matching as seen in the example.

TIP: Use the callback {{% docref "lexy::as_string" %}} to convert the {{% docref "lexy::lexeme" %}} to a string.

=== Reserving identifiers

{{% interface %}}
----
constexpr _identifier-dsl_ reserve(_rule_ auto ... rules) const; <1>
constexpr _identifier-dsl_ reserve_prefix(_rule_ auto ... rules) const; <2>
constexpr _identifier-dsl_ reserve_containing(_rule_ auto ... rules) const; <3>
----

[.lead]
Reserves an identifier.

Initially, no identifier is reserved.
Identifiers are reserved by calling `.reserve()` or its variants.
If this has happened, parsing the `identifier` rule creates a partial input from the lexeme and matches it against the specified rules as follows:

* (1) `.reserve()`: All rules specified here are matched against the partial input.
  If they match the entire partial input, the identifier is reserved.
  This is comparable to {{% docref "lexy::dsl::operator-" %}}.
* (2) `.reserve_prefix()`: All rules specified here are matched against the partial input.
  If they match a prefix of the partial input, the identifier is reserved.
  This is comparable to {{% docref "lexy::dsl::operator-" %}} with {{% docref "lexy::dsl::prefix" %}}.
* (3) `.reserve_containing()`: All rules specified here are matched against the partial input.
  If they match somewhere in the partial input, the identifier is reserved.
  This is comparable to {{% docref "lexy::dsl::operator-" %}} with {{% docref "lexy::dsl::contains" %}}.

{{% playground-example reserved_identifier "Parse a C like identifier that is not reserved" %}}

CAUTION: The `identifier` rule doesn't magically learn about the keywords you have created.
They are only reserved if you actually pass them to `.reserve()`.
This design allows you to use a different set of reserved identifiers in different places in the grammar.

NOTE: The common case of passing keywords or literals to `.reserve()` is optimized using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie[trie].

=== Token rule `.pattern()`

{{% interface %}}
----
constexpr _token-rule_ auto pattern() const;
----

[.lead]
`.pattern()` is a {{% token-rule %}} that matches the basic form of the identifier without checking for reserved identifiers.

Matching::
  Matches and consumes `leading`,
  then matches and consumes {{% docref "lexy::dsl::while_" %}}`(trailing)`,
  where `leading` and `trailing` are the arguments passed to `identifier()`.
  Whitespace skipping is disabled inside the `pattern()`,
  but it will be skipped after `pattern()`.
Errors::
  All errors raised by matching `leading`.
  The rule then fails.
Parse tree::
  A single token node whose range covers everything consumed.
  Its {{% docref "lexy::predefined_token_kind" %}} is `lexy::identifier_token_kind`.

=== Token rules `.leading_pattern()`, `.trailing_pattern()`

{{% interface %}}
----
constexpr _token-rule_ auto leading_pattern() const;
constexpr _token-rule_ auto trailing_pattern() const;
----

[.lead]
They simply return `leading`/`trailing` from the arguments passed to `identifier()`.

[#keyword]
== Token rule `lexy::dsl::keyword`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl
{
    template <auto Str>
    constexpr _token-rule_ auto keyword(_identifier-dsl_ identifier);
}

#define LEXY_KEYWORD(Str, Identifier) lexy::dsl::keyword<Str>(identifier)
----

[.lead]
`keyword` is a {{% token-rule %}} that matches a keyword.

Matching::
  Tries to match and consume `identifier.pattern()`,
  i.e. the basic pattern of an identifier ignoring any reserved identifiers.
  Then creates a partial input that covers everything just consumed (without the trailing whitespace)
  and matches {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit" %}}`<Str>` on that input.
  Succeeds only if that consumes the entire partial input.
Errors::
  {{% docref "lexy::expected_keyword" %}}: if either `identifier.pattern()` or the `lit` rule failed.
  Its range covers the everything consumed by `identifier.pattern()` and its `.string()` is `Str`.

The macro `LEXY_KEYWORD(Str, Identifier)` is equivalent to `keyword<Str>(Identifier)`,
except that it also works on older compilers that do not support C++20's extended NTTPs.
Use this instead of `keyword<Str>(identifier)` if you need to support them.

{{% playground-example keyword "Parse a keyword" %}}

NOTE: While {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit" %}}`<"int">` would happily consume a prefix of `"integer"`, `keyword<"int">(id)`, for a matching `id`, would not.

NOTE: A keyword does not necessarily need to be a reserved identifier or vice-versa.

NOTE: The same {{% encoding %}} caveats of {{% docref "lexy::dsl::lit" %}} apply here as well.
